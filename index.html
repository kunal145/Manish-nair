				<h5>Employability</h5>
				<div class="pra">
					<p>In the realm of employment, a single word that gained physical existence only in 2021, challenges have always been prevalent in our country. India, known as the youth capital, boasts the largest captive audience of eager learners and torchbearers of modern India. Recognizing this immense potential, we embarked on a journey to create a book on "EMPLOYABILITY."
						Our goal is to assess opportunities against the gold standards and bridge the gap between industry expectations and the lack of appropriate resources. We critically examined the enhancement of learners' quality and aimed to equip them for higher packages and career aspirations. By benchmarking against the evolving job market, we endeavored to provide the best preparatory tool in the form of this book. Our aim is to guide today's youth and bring them closer to the vision of a "skill India," both on a personal level and for our nation.</p>
					<!-- <p>as a single word never had a physical existence until 2021 and employment was, is, and will always be going to be a difficult challenge in our country, India is called a youth capital and hence we have the largest captive audience as great learners and torch bearers of modern India to think of. Our effort in conceptualizing the book on "EMPLOYABILITY", is to measure the opportunity with the gold standards and bridge the gap between what is desired by the Industries and what many lack in terms of the right material. We also had a  critical look at the improvement of the learner's quality and make them best prepared for the higher packages and career goals. Benchmarking the newer version of whatever is prevailing in the job scenario market and pushing ourselves to bring in the best preparatory tool with the help of this book, to guide the youth of today and get them as close as possible to our personal and country’s vision of “skill India”.</p> -->

				<h5>Artist</h5>
				<div class="pra">
					<p>As my journey as a trainer evolved, I delved deeper into the intricacies of voice modulation, word stress, diction, and the rate of speech. These invaluable skills have not only enhanced my training abilities but have also opened new doors of opportunity. I have embraced roles as an Anchor, where my commanding voice and engaging delivery captivate audiences. As a Master of Ceremony, I seamlessly guide events, creating a seamless flow of energy and excitement. With my versatile voice, I have lent my talents as a singer, evoking emotions through melodic expressions. Additionally, as a voice-over artist, I have left my mark on advertisements, dance dramas, plays, and concerts, contributing to their success. Remaining steadfast in my commitment to growth, I continuously seek industry-specific nuances, challenging myself to reach new heights.
